## Introduction

This document tests that unreferenced bibliography entries are preserved.

## References Section

Here are some references that are cited:

The first source is important<a href="#bib-1" class="citation-link">[1]</a>.
The third source provides context<a href="#bib-3" class="citation-link">[3]</a>.

Note: We intentionally skip [2] and [4] but they should still be in the bibliography.
