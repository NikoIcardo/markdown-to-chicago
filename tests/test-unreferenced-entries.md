## Introduction

This document tests that missing citation links are added when a bibliography URL appears in the document without a citation.

## References Section

Here are some references that already have citation links:

The first source is important<a href="#bib-1" class="citation-link">[1]</a>.
The third source provides context<a href="#bib-3" class="citation-link">[3]</a>.

## Missing Citations Section

Here we reference URLs from the bibliography WITHOUT citation links - they should be added:
