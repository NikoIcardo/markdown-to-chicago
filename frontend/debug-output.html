<p>Psychological warfare has been a staple of military engagement for centuries. It has long been demonstrated that weakening the morale and wellbeing of soldiers and civilians contributes to victory in battle and the demise of nations. Its use has been a prevalent component of conflict in nearly all recent history. Consider this excerpt about <a href="https://info.publicintelligence.net/GermanPropagandaLeaflets.pdf">Psychological Warfare in World War 2</a><a href="#bib-1">[1]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“During World War II, Psychological Warfare became recognized as an important weapon at the disposal of all combatants. Its dual aim was to build up the user’s home-front, his troops, and his allies; and at the same time attack, undermine and destroy those of the enemy. Truths, half -truths, lies and rumors were spread by as many different media as there were means to carry the written and spoken word.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For instance both <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/Mildred-Gillars">Axis</a> and <a href="https://codenames.info/operation/soldatensender-calais/">Allied </a>nations operated fake radio stations that broadcasted to enemy troops in their own languages and spread misinformation, lies, and demoralizing statements meant to undermine morale and weaken support to their countries<a href="#bib-2">[2]</a><a href="#bib-3">[3]</a>. These same sorts of messages were employed via leaflets that were dropped by airplane and fired by cannons again by both <a href="https://info.publicintelligence.net/GermanPropagandaLeaflets.pdf">Axis</a> and <a href="https://britishonlinearchives.com/posts/category/articles/436/airborne-propaganda-the-battle-for-hearts-and-minds">Allied</a> powers<a href="#bib-1">[1]</a><a href="#bib-4">[4]</a>.</p>
<p>In a CIA reading room document titled <a href="https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/COMMUNIST%20PSYCHOLOGICAL%20W%5B16009245%5D.pdf">“Communist Psychological Warfare in the Framework of the Cold War”</a>, there is a quote that dates to writing in the 4th century BC that discusses how covert and psychological warfare is superior to brute force military engagements<a href="#bib-5">[5]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“...There are other means in order to conquer the country of your enemy without losing the riches of that country. The following is the acme of skillful warfare: Have hand-picked men penetrate unnoticed into the country of your enemy. Have them reconnoiter for the weaknesses in the enemy’s fortresses. Furnish them with ample means so that they will be able to buy the enemy’s counselors. Let them sow [destruct] in the hearts of its friends and instigate hatred in the hearts of its enemies. Let them induce infidelity in the enemy’s wives and foster jealousy among its sons. Promise freedom to its slaves and have them instigate mutiny among the body guard of your enemy. Poison the wells from which the beasts of burden drink and burn down the [store] houses containing war materials. Commit atrocities against your enemy’s people in your enemy’s name so that the people will grumble and hate your enemy. First, send your agents in order to accomplish all that and then set your army in motion to occupy the country. With the country in unrest and with his friends and relatives set against him, your opponent will not think of giving battle to you. He will flee into his secret hideout, leaving you all his riches.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This sentiment was echoed in many overt means in the cold war. Varieties of advancing tactics were used. As just a few overt tactics, the US broadcasted foreign language <a href="https://www.dday.center/the-use-of-psychological-warfare-in-europe/">radio into the Eastern Bloc</a><a href="#bib-6">[6]</a>. The KGB spread rumors in the 1980s that AIDs was created by a <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/operation-denver-kgb-and-stasi-disinformation-regarding-aids">US biological weapon.</a> The Czechoslovak intelligence service used fake planted <a href="https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/cold-war-disinformation-new-revelations-about-operation-neptune-czech-archives">Nazi Documents to smear and embarrass West Germany</a><a href="#bib-7">[7]</a><a href="#bib-8">[8]</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“One of the most important means in subjecting the opponent’s will is psychological warfare of which the most prominent form of expression is propaganda. Psychological warfare aims at breaking the enemy’s will to resist by systematically belaboring the spirit, or, better, by undermining the morale of the opponent.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/COMMUNIST%20PSYCHOLOGICAL%20W%5B16009245%5D.pdf">https://www.cia.gov/readingroom/docs/COMMUNIST%20PSYCHOLOGICAL%20W%5B16009245%5D.pdf</a><a href="#bib-5">[5]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given the historical precedent of psychological warfare, the increasing prevalence of its use in recent conflicts, and the enablement of advancing tactics as technological innovations continue to emerge, the growing risks of psychological warfare in the modern day cannot be over-stated. Its increasing potential and diversifying techniques is substantiated by recent aggressions and peace-time attacks on the US by our foreign adversaries.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gmfus.org/news/target-usa-key-takeaways-kremlins-project-lakhta">The 2016 Russian election interference campaigns </a>were deliberate misinformation and psychological missions aimed at warping public perception<a href="#bib-9">[9]</a>. Bot farms and fake social media accounts were created en masse to engage in deceptive political dialogue, drive radicalism, further divide, and politically fracture the United States. These are part of ongoing effort known as <a href="https://www.gmfus.org/news/target-usa-key-takeaways-kremlins-project-lakhta">Project Lakhta</a><a href="#bib-9">[9]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Project Lakhta’s strategic goal is not just to target elections, but “to sow division and discord in the U.S. political system, including by creating social and political polarization” and by “undermining faith in democratic institutions.” The Project’s preparations for manipulation are extensive, beginning years before any election, and the Kremlin has proved willing and able to seize on developing issues opportunistically to achieve its goals. For example, as described by the FBI, Project Lakhta latched onto divisive events such as the NFL national anthem debate, mass shootings in Charleston and Las Vegas, and the Charlottesville “Unite the Right” rally to spur polarization outside the context of elections. As such, the Kremlin’s online political war is extensive and ongoing, it did not stop after 2016, and it will not stop after 2018.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additional descriptions and testaments to this ongoing Russian effort have been released officially by the <a href="https://www.fbi.gov/news/press-releases/joint-odni-fbi-and-cisa-statement-110424">ODNI, FBI, and CISA</a><a href="#bib-10">[10]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Influence actors linked to Russia in particular are manufacturing videos and creating fake articles to undermine the legitimacy of the [2020] election, instill fear in voters regarding the election process, and suggest Americans are using violence against each other due to political preferences, judging from information available to the IC. These efforts risk inciting violence, including against election officials.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s difficult to measure the impact of these aggressions. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.11690">We do know that civilians are engaging with these interferences.</a> Additionally, reports and analysis on the American political divide state that America is currently polarizing quicker than any other country on the planet<a href="#bib-11">[11]</a>. Consider this conclusion by Rachel Kleinfield in her 2023 paper “<a href="https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2023/09/polarization-democracy-and-political-violence-in-the-united-states-what-the-research-says?lang=en">Polarization, Democracy, and Political Violence in the United States: What the Research Says</a>”<a href="#bib-12">[12]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The American public feels affectively polarized largely because of misunderstandings about the other side (though the misunderstandings seem sensitive to actual ideological differences). Older Americans are polarizing more quickly than younger Americans. And the United States is polarizing much more rapidly than other Western democracies; partisans even more so. However, the United States may not be more affectively polarized than a number of other multiparty democracies whose systems are functioning much better. The rapidity of U.S. polarization compared to similar wealthy, consolidated democracies suggests that domestic issues in the United States are likely to be driving more of the country’s polarization than issues affecting many other countries.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We can also see that US political terrorism is on the rise. Examine this image taken from another <a href="https://www.journalofdemocracy.org/articles/the-rise-of-political-violence-in-the-united-states/">Rachel Kleinfeld paper “The Rise of Political Violence in the United States”</a> which she sourced from the Global Terrorism Database<a href="#bib-13">[13]</a>:</p>
<p><a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qi2m!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F820821ee-a2c1-4a35-9b8f-b52448b3bf30_1024x802.jpeg"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qi2m!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F820821ee-a2c1-4a35-9b8f-b52448b3bf30_1024x802.jpeg" alt=""></a><a href="#bib-14">[14]</a></p>
<p>The Russian political interference campaign demonstrates the diversifying innovations of psychological warfare. With polarization and violence rising, the threat this type of attack poses is apparent. Online information deception is an emerging venue of psychological warfare. In another evolution, we see advanced psychological weapons being used on US civilians.</p>
<h4 id="anomalous-health-incidents">Anomalous Health Incidents<a href="#anomalous-health-incidents" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h4>
<p>The Havana Syndrome events also known as Anomalous Health Incidents or AHI’s, were first recognized as a series of US and Canadian Diplomats and Embassy staff reporting negative health effects in Havana Cuba, 2016, although official reports had been submitted <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-118hhrg58217/html/CHRG-118hhrg58217.htm">as early as 2014</a><a href="#bib-15">[15]</a>. The <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-118hhrg58217/html/CHRG-118hhrg58217.htm">effects were reported</a> as “debilitating migraines, perceived sounds, dizziness, vertigo, fatigue, nausea, anxiety, cognitive difficulties, and memory loss”<a href="#bib-15">[15]</a>.</p>
<p>As these AHI occurrences were researched further, more of these reports streamed in from around the world from <a href="https://www.gao.gov/assets/880/870314.pdf">Germany to China to Vietnam, and even in Washington DC</a><a href="#bib-16">[16]</a>. A series of conclusions came out of various government departments claiming varieties of explanations from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK566408/">psychogenic illness and hysteria</a> to <a href="https://ndupress.ndu.edu/Media/News/News-Article-View/Article/3262785/havana-syndrome-directed-attack-or-cricket-noise/">even insects</a><a href="#bib-17">[17]</a><a href="#bib-18">[18]</a>. The officially reported conclusion is much more concerning.</p>
<p>After much <a href="https://nsarchive.gwu.edu/briefing-book/cuba/2021-02-10/secrets-havana-syndrome-how-trumps-state-department-cia-mishandled-mysterious-maladies-cuba?utm_source=chatgpt.com">debate and confusion</a>, a hearing was held in 2024 before the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/event/118th-congress/house-event/117249">House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Counterterrorism, Law Enforcement, and Intelligence</a> to give some clarity on the matter<a href="#bib-19">[19]</a><a href="#bib-20">[20]</a>. The meeting was titled “ <em>Silent Weapons: Examining Foreign Anomalous Health Incidents Targeting Americans in the Homeland and Abroad.”</em> In the meeting numerous sources presented that the most plausible explanation was the use of Direct Energy Weapons by foreign adversaries. “[Overall, directed pulsed RF energy, especially in those with the distinct early manifestations, appears to be the most plausible mechanism in explaining these cases among those that the committee considered](<a href="http://An">http://An</a> Assessment of Illness in U<a href="#bib-21">[21]</a>.S. Government Employees and Their Families at Overseas Embassies)”. This conclusion was supported by both the panel of expert speakers and the State Department’s commissioned report from the <a href="https://www.nationalacademies.org/">National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine</a> titled <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/25889/an-assessment-of-illness-in-us-government-employees-and-their-families-at-overseas-embassies">‘An Assessment of Illness in U.S. Government Employees and Their Families at Overseas Embassies’</a><a href="#bib-22">[22]</a><a href="#bib-23">[23]</a>.</p>
<p>In the hearing, experts gave personal testimony on the existence of Directed Energy Weapons being used on US military, US embassy personnel and their families. They also directly testified that US civilians had reached out claiming these technologies were being used on them. What’s concerning, is that it appears that the perception of these attacks is that it’s some sort of new phenomena. This is evidenced by numerous agencies failing to consider foreign adversary energy weapons in their reports on the matter and that the witnesses had to educate those present in the congressional hearing on the history and plausibility of these of weapons. This is despite the fact that the US and public were made aware of microwave energy weapons in the 70’s. Here are some excerpts from the panel experts’ testimony at the House hearing:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Before Havana Syndrome there was the Moscow Signal. From the 1950’s to 1970’s, Soviet intelligence bathed the US Embassy and diplomatic quarters in Moscow with microwave transmissions every day. The health effects were similar to what we see today. Again, the survivors were accused of mass hysteria and told nothing about the causes of their symptoms, until the government finally informed the staff in 1976 at a confidential meeting. The U.S. Embassy personnel immediately leaked to U.S. newspapers, setting off a major scandal in U.S.-Soviet relations and resulted in a Congressional Investigation which was completed in 1979.”</p>

<p>“We have established that the Russian government has a long-running R&amp;D program to develop a class of weapons known in Russia as “wave weapons” - a cumulative term for acoustic and/or electromagnetic directed-energy emission devices that may be used as either lethal or non-lethal weapons. While the program has its origin in Soviet times - and certain military patents in this area was registered as early as the 1970s - the R&amp;D work in this area was boosted in 2013 through the creation of a new entity by Vladimir Putin that was tasked to develop “weapons based on new physical properties including ray weapons and wave weapons”. This entity, called the Institute for Prospective Military Studies, has been running annual closed contests among military engineers and scientists for the delivery of prototypes - along with accompanying test data - of such weapons.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“There is a wealth of publicly-available information concerning the history of directed energy and particularly its scientific, intelligence, and military applications. From the days of Nikola Tesla proposing concepts in the 19th Century of his <code>death ray’‘ to direct electromagnetic energy to disable machinery or personnel, to recent patents to create a </code>non-lethal and non-destructive electromagnetic personnel interdiction control stun type weapon system’‘ and methods to utilize beamed radio frequency energy, to active Department of Defense (<code>DoD’‘) solicitations to </code>develop a low-cost, low-weight, small-size wearable radio frequency (RF) weapon exposure detector.’‘ None of this is new. Just last year the Government Accountability Office issued a report that ``DOD is currently developing directed energy weapons with the goal of defeating a range of threats, including drones and missiles.’‘ Why would anyone fail to believe our adversaries, some of whom are bound by far less ethical parameters, are not engaged in the same efforts, or particularly focused on the use of a weapon against humans? In fact, they have told us so.</p>

<p>There are many people who believe they are victims of AHI’s. All you have to do is look at my Twitter feed whenever I post on the topic. I only represent Federal Government employees and their families, so I don’t focus on the accuracy of those particular claims.”</p>

<p>This testimony demonstrates that the United States government has known about the existence and effects of microwave energy weapons and that Russia was using them on Americans since the 1950’s. To further substantiate this, here is a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1976/02/26/archives/moscow-rays-linked-to-us-bugging-moscow-radiation-is-now-linked-to.html">1976 New York Times Article: Moscow Rays Linked to U.S. Bugging by Bernard Gwertzman</a><a href="#bib-26">[26]</a>:</p>

<p>Havana Syndrome demonstrates an evolving class of psychological warfare technology and methodology: the use of advanced energy weapons to disrupt, confuse, and incapacitate military and political personnel. The proposed effects of direct energy weapons however are not restricted to those reported in the Havana Syndrome cases. They are a subset of many possible applications of a developing class known as psychotronic weapons. The next section examines military reports from the late 90’s detailing the wide range of these weapons’ potential uses.</p>

<p>Timothy L. Thomas, a current senior analyst at the Foreign Military Studies Office at Ft. Leavenworth, KS, wrote a <a href="https://www.armywarcollege.edu/">US Army War College</a> Report in 1998 titled <a href="https://press.armywarcollege.edu/parameters/vol28/iss1/12/">‘The Mind Has No Firewall’</a><a href="#bib-27">[27]</a><a href="#bib-28">[28]</a>. The article was intended to draw attention to the Russians development of new concept psychological weapons. Examine this excerpt:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“wonder weapons” (acoustics, microwaves, lasers)...scientists are searching the electromagnetic and sonic spectrums for wavelengths that can affect human behavior.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And quoted Russian Army Major I. Chernishev</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is completely clear that the state which is first to create such weapons will achieve incomparable superiority.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thomas detailed that at the time of writing, the US had its own research initiatives already examining the following aspects of these technologies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“several of them designed, among other things, to vibrate the insides of humans, stun or nauseate them, put them to sleep, heat them up, or knock them down with a shock wave. The technologies include dazzling lasers that can force the pupils to close; acoustic or sonic frequencies that cause the hair cells in the inner ear to vibrate and cause motion sickness, vertigo, and nausea, or frequencies that resonate the internal organs causing pain and spasms; and shock waves with the potential to knock down humans or airplanes”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, this description sounds very similar to the Havana Syndrome reports. Despite this information being discussed in the late 90’s, US intelligence agencies were reporting that they had no knowledge of these weapons in their official reports on the AHI’s and the Havana syndrome. It appears that they were deliberately misleading Congress in their investigations into the matter. Consider this statement from the National Intelligence Council’s (NIC) “<a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/NIC-Unclassified-ICA-Updated-Assessment-AHI-December2024.pdf">Updated Assessment of Anomalous Health Incidents, as of December 2024</a>”<a href="#bib-29">[29]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Five IC components continue to assess it is “very unlikely” a foreign actor has a capability, such as a pulsed radiofrequency (RF) energy weapon or prototype device, to cause the symptoms and sensory phenomena associated with events reported as possible AHIs.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>How can this be true if we have known about the damaging physiological effects of Russian Electromagnetic Radiation weapons since the 70’s and have documented that the Russians and the US were researching these weapons in military reports from the 90’s? A sentiment of disbelief and distrust in the NIC’s statements is growing both <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/national-security/split-emerges-us-spy-agencies-mysterious-havana-syndrome-rcna187187">publicly</a> and within our <a href="https://intelligence.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1486">government</a><a href="#bib-30">[30]</a><a href="#bib-31">[31]</a>. It appears that these agencies may be deliberately attempting to cover up the existence of these weapons. Stated in The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence’s <a href="https://intelligence.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1486">Dec. 2024 press release</a> on AHI’s is the following<a href="#bib-31">[31]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This interim report also criticizes the Intelligence Community (IC) for thwarting the Committee’s investigation into AHIs. The IC’s conclusions that foreign adversaries aren’t responsible for targeting U.S. personnel are dubious at best and misleading at worst.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thomas’s report states the US was aware of and researching the applications of weapons that could cause Havana Syndrome like symptoms in the 90s. Though, this is not the full extent of psychotronic weapon developments. Further in his report, he reveals the scope of these weapons’ development not only includes the ability to cause physiological ailment and confusion, but also the ability to directly influence and effect the mind itself. He details how Russian army officials discussed in writing the global technological developments of ‘psy weapons’ that had the following capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A psychotronic generator, which produces a powerful electromagnetic emanation capable of being sent through telephone lines, TV, radio networks, supply pipes, and incandescent lamps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An autonomous generator, a device that operates in the 10-150 Hertz band, which at the 10-20 Hertz band forms an infrasonic oscillation that is destructive to all living creatures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A nervous system generator, designed to paralyze the central nervous systems of insects, which could have the same applicability to humans.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ultrasound emanations, which one institute claims to have developed. Devices using ultrasound emanations are supposedly capable of carrying out bloodless internal operations without leaving a mark on the skin. They can also, according to Chernishev, be used to kill.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Noiseless cassettes. Chernishev claims that the Japanese have developed the ability to place infra-low frequency voice patterns over music, patterns that are detected by the subconscious. Russians claim to be using similar “bombardments” with computer programming to treat alcoholism or smoking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 25th-frame effect, alluded to above, a technique wherein each 25th frame of a movie reel or film footage contains a message that is picked up by the subconscious. This technique, if it works, could possibly be used to curb smoking and alcoholism, but it has wider, more sinister applications if used on a TV audience or a computer operator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Psychotropics, defined as medical preparations used to induce a trance, euphoria, or depression. Referred to as “slow-acting mines,” they could be slipped into the food of a politician or into the water supply of an entire city. <strong>Symptoms include headaches, noises, voices or commands in the brain, dizziness, pain in the abdominal cavities, cardiac arrhythmia, or even the destruction of the cardiovascular system</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The last one is of particular concern, the ability to cause one to hear noises or voices and commands in the brain. He continues:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“There is confirmation from US researchers that this type of study is going on. Dr. Janet Morris, coauthor of The Warrior’s Edge, reportedly went to the Moscow Institute of Psychocorrelations in 1991. There she was shown a technique pioneered by the Russian Department of Psycho-Correction at Moscow Medical Academy in which researchers electronically analyze the human mind in order to influence it. They input subliminal command messages, using key words transmitted in “white noise” or music. Using an infra-sound, very low frequency transmission, the acoustic psycho-correction message is transmitted via bone conduction.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus research was being done as early as 1991 to transmit subliminal messaging and commands into peoples’ minds via infra sound and low frequency transmissions. Continuing on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In summary, Chernishev noted that some of the militarily significant aspects of the “psy” weaponry deserve closer research, including the following nontraditional methods for disrupting the psyche of an individual:</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>ESP research: determining the properties and condition of objects without ever making contact with them and “reading” peoples’ thoughts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Clairvoyance research: observing objects that are located just beyond the world of the visible--used for intelligence purposes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Telepathy research: transmitting thoughts over a distance--used for covert operations</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Telekinesis research: actions involving the manipulation of physical objects using thought power, causing them to move or break apart--used against command and control systems, or to disrupt the functioning of weapons of mass destruction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Psychokinesis research: interfering with the thoughts of individuals, on either the strategic or tactical level”</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Meriting closer attention are the research objectives to create technology that can read people’s thoughts, communicate thoughts over a distance, and interfere with the thoughts of individuals.</p>
<h4 id="human-network-attacks">Human Network Attacks<a href="#human-network-attacks" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h4>
<p>In another article by Thomas published in 1999, <a href="https://online.fliphtml5.com/Article-on-psych-weapons/zczi/">Human Network Attacks </a> discusses how China and Russia believed that it was important to conduct psychological warfare operations using psychotronic weapons during peace time<a href="#bib-32">[32]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“In fact, there is even some agreement among Chinese and Russian psychologists about the growing importance of both countering and conducting peacetime information-psychological defensive and offensive operations.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here he discusses in length the focus of Chinese military writing on new age weaponry:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Chinese writings have not emphasized psychotronic weapons or suggestive influences, as have the Russians. Rather, they have focused on the impact of what they term “new-concept weapons,” such as infrasound weapons, lasers, microwave and particle-beam weapons and incoherent light sources. Speaking to foreign participants, analyst Wang Zhi added ultraviolet radiation, anti-environment (earthquakes, for example) and biological weapons to this list. These innovations will allow decision makers to select and adjust the intensity of war according to their needs. One needs simply to “turn up the volume” if a technique is not working.</p>
<p>Infrasound weapons use sound waves with frequencies lower than 20 Hz to cause cardiac, respiratory, digestive and central nervous system malfunctions, disorientation and emotional disorders. The journal People’s Military Surgeon noted that such a weapon has already been developed and tested, and that infrasound waves generated by the device are adjustable to cause controllable amounts of disorientation, nausea, vomiting and incontinence. The journal also describes the use of microwave weapons to cause electronic interference, lasers to disable equipment and incoherent light sources and super-high frequency weapons, with the latter capable of interfering with the functioning of the human nervous system and capable of causing unbearable noise and whistling sounds. The People’s Military Surgeon article ended on the ominous note:</p>
<p>“Weapons generating interference and causing blindness have become practical to use. Foreign armed forces already have corresponding prevention and protection measures, standard, and diagnostic techniques, and have conducted further research . . . [and] microwave electronic interference equipment is already widely utilized. Therefore, medical protection against microwaves are already being developed.”</p>
<p>The Chinese military apparently believes these devices will be used in future war since its doctors are investigating treatment for injuries caused by special types of high-tech or [new concept] weapons.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reiterating, US military personnel were aware of the presence of psychological weapons and the potential for our adversaries to be using them at the time of Thomas’s writings. This includes that the Chinese were developing weapons that could cause “emotional disorders”. Next Thomas expands with discussion on how Russian psychological warfare had been evolving at the time:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The Russian armed forces are studying a host of unusual subjects, almost all of which center on how information or electronic waves affect the mind. For example, a recent book offered an extensive set of algorithms designed to implant “suggestive influences” or what the author called “psycho viruses” into a person’s mind. This officially sanctioned book was commissioned by the Security Committee of the State Duma. The leader of a Security Committee subset, the Information Security Committee of the State Duma, co-authored a book on Psychotronic Weapons as well.</p>
<p>This latter subject has been one of intense military interest over the past several years. An article that appeared in the armed forces journal Orientier a few years ago was titled “Can a Ruler make `Zombies’ Out of the World?” with a subtitle reading “It is completely possible that humanity is standing on the verge of psychotronic war.” The article described many of the “psy” weapons available for use, such as VHF generators, lasers, X-ray equipment, ultrasound and radio waves. A psychotronic generator, for example, was described as a device that produces powerful electromagnetic emanations.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Defense reportedly has a special unit known as 10003. According to the newspaper Novaya Gazeta-Ponedelnik (clearly not a mainstream newspaper and therefore suspect), this unit studies mysticism and the occult, primarily to understand the essence of mind control (for use in recruiting and other situations). In other words, the Russians are exhaustively exploring what makes the mind tick and how to manage it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In their search to offset Western supremacy in the IW [Information Warfare] arena, Russian and Chinese theorists are exploring nontraditional, asymmetric approaches. One is to utilize the capabilities of psychological operations and deception to fool one’s cognitive processes, especially the case in China, on the strategic level. Another is to control the mind and to affect the nervous system.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Consider in particular the statement “For example, a recent book offered an extensive set of algorithms designed to implant “suggestive influences” or what the author called “psycho viruses” into a person’s mind”. What exactly is meant by the term “psycho viruses” is not explained in the article, however there are numerous descriptions that can be found across a variety of discussions on Chinese and Russian psychological warfare. Consider the following description from a 2023 RAND institute overview titled <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA853-1.html">“Chinese Next-Generation Psychological Warfare: The Military Applications of Emerging Technologies and Implications for the United States”</a><a href="#bib-33">[33]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The specific effect mechanism of psycho-virus concept is attacking an adversary’s BCI [Brain Computing Interface] system to influence cognitive functions. The authors state, “The brain-computer interface can be attacked by hackers and used to counter the wearer of the brain-computer interface, such as stimulating specific brain areas in a malicious way.” Specifically, the authors envision “a paragraph of text, a sentence, an expression, a behavior, etc., [and,] after being implanted in the human brain, it quickly replicates itself and destroys the normal cognition of the human brain by manipulating its behavior, will, and beliefs.” The authors argue the concept combines the characteristics of computer and biological viruses: It is infectious, concealed, parasitic, transmissive, latent, irritability, self-reproducing, regenerative, variable, and of similar performance and destructiveness.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Psycho viruses as a concept can then be understood as notions implanted into someones brain that take hold of their thoughts and influence their will and behavior to complete an objective. This coupled with the aforementioned research to communicate voices and commands into peoples’ heads, and create emotional disorders raises a concerning possibility: the ability to a create a mental state in a target where one is emotionally compromised and is receiving commands attempting to influence their behavior.</p>
<p>With the knowledge that these applications were being actively investigated by our foreign adversaries in the 90’s, and that these same adversaries are committed to conducting peace-time psychological offenses, offenses that target civilians like project Lakhta, then its possible that civilians are being targeted with mind altering technology. After all, other psychotronic weapon technologies discussed in the report that cause physiological ailments are likely being used to target our embassy staff, military personnel, and their families. Mr. Mark Zaid from the congressional hearing also <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-118hhrg58217/html/CHRG-118hhrg58217.htm">testified that other civilians had reached out to him</a> saying they were also experiencing AHI’s<a href="#bib-15">[15]</a>.</p>
<p>It warrant the question, are US civilians being targeted with other forms of psychotronic weapons, those that have the ability to psychologically compromise them and instruct them to do things that would likely have negative overtones?</p>
<h4 id="voices-and-violence">Voices and Violence<a href="#voices-and-violence" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h4>
<p>The possibilities of psychological warfare are ever expanding and evolving. Psychotronic weapon development has emerged in one capacity to cause physiological damage, confusion, and societal uproar, and the possibilities expounded upon above for other psychotronic weapons include the possibilities to emotionally destabilize individuals and communicate commands. Given that other psychological warfare operations are being conducted with psychotronic weapons, is this additional possibility being exercised on US civilians right now? If it were, what would it look like? Examine the following instances of US civilians claiming they were hearing emotionally distressing voices giving commands for them to exercise violence. These cases in particular actually led the individuals to commit these acts.</p>
<p>In 2018, Danuel Drayton committed a series of atrocious murders. After being caught, he confessed that he had heard voices telling him “that they had to die”.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>On October 25th, 2023, a man named Robert Card shot and killed 18 people and wounded 13 others in Lewiston, Maine. He was a member of the Army Reserve and a Firearms instructor who began to hear voices that said horrible things about him.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“He was picking up voices that he had never heard,” she told NBC News. “His mind was twisting them around. He was humiliated by the things that he thought were being said.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For Robert these voices started to occur when he was 40. Understand that the typical development for Schizophrenia is during the early years of adulthood.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>There are numerous other examples.</p>
<p>The prospect that someone could be experiencing the effects of psychotronic weapons commanding them to commit violence is plausible given the evidence aforementioned. It is important to consider that there are plausible medical reasons for these scenarios.</p>
<h4 id="why-someone-might-hear-voices">Why someone might hear voices<a href="#why-someone-might-hear-voices" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h4>
<p>There are a variety of well established psychiatric and medical reasons why someone would hear voices. For one, there is the true possibility of schizophrenia, which for prolonged experiences of hearing voices, seems to be the most common assessment. <a href="https://ia800707.us.archive.org/15/items/info_munsha_DSM5/DSM-5.pdf">From the DSM-V, the current standard for psychiatric diagnoses, on Schizophrenia, page 87</a><a href="#bib-48">[48]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Hallucinations are perception-like experiences that occur without an external stimulus. They are vivid and clear, with the full force and impact of normal perceptions, and not under voluntary control. They may occur in any sensory modality, <strong>but auditory hallucinations</strong> <strong>are the most common in schizophrenia and related disorders.</strong> <strong>Auditory hallucinations are usually experienced as voices, whether familiar or unfamiliar, that are perceived as distinct from the individual’s own thoughts.”</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another reason is that people with traumatic brain injury, or TBI, may experience auditory hallucinations<a href="#bib-49">[49]</a>. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24263164/">From ‘Management of auditory hallucinations as a sequela of traumatic brain injury: a case report and a relevant literature review’ by Yuriy Dobry, Vladan Novakovic, Robert L Barkin, Vikram K Sundaram:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Although infrequent, auditory hallucinations is a debilitating complication of TBI that can manifest itself 4-5 years after the occurrence of (TBI). Because the age range of TBI survivors is 15-24 years, and the chance of developing post-TBI psychosis is reported to be up to 20%, this chronic neuropsychiatric complication and the available treatment options warrant close scrutiny from the clinical and the biomedical research community.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And furthermore, a sometimes unfortunately unacknowledged, but very well documented phenomenon is the disorder known as Dissociative Identity Disorder or (DID)<a href="#bib-50">[50]</a>. Consider the paper <a href="https://endritualabuse.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/chapter4finalrevisions2008.pdf">“Guidelines to Differential Diagnosis between Schizophrenia and Ritual Abuse/Mind Control Traumatic Stress” by Ellen P. Lacter, Ph.D., and Karl Lehman, M.D.:</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) is present, hearing vocalizations of other “parts” is common, commonly including conversations or arguing between personalities, children’s voices, crying or screaming, or even sounds of animal “parts”. Hearing voices of abusers is also common. Voices criticizing the host, giving hostile commands, or predicting danger can also occur, but are rarely the only voices heard.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Despite these considerations, Thomas’s aforementioned military reports suggest there is a possibility that US foreign adversaries have developed the ability to influence peoples’ minds and psychological wellbeing. If US adversaries have been proven to employ advanced psychological warfare methods of targeting, disrupting, and sabotaging our country, and it is known that they have been developing psychotronic energy weapons designed to mentally incapacitate targets and plant “psycho viruses” into people’s minds, and in addition they have written about the importance of “conducting peacetime information-psychological…offensive operations” then it is a possibility that they are targeting individuals civilians’ mental health and attempting to disorient, subvert, and destabilize US citizens for a variety of reasons whether to cause violence, or to damage our society in other ways.</p>
<p>An aspect as to why we may not be recognizing the attacks of these sorts of psychotronic weapons is that they could be hidden behind the perception that they are resultant of one of the medical issues mentioned above. With recent confirmations of psychotronic weapon developments and use, and technological objectives for psychotronic weapons set forth by US foreign adversaries, this possibility cannot be readily denied. Especially given that there is a substantial number of US civilians that have been claiming to be attacked with these weapons for decades.</p>
<p>In the following section is an overview of the attempts US and world civilians have made to argue that the weapons mentioned in Thomas’s report exist and are being used on the public.</p>

<hr>
<p>There have been millions of reports of people claiming they are being targeted with advanced psychological weapons for decades. Its phenomenon has grown into an entire sub-culture marked by terminology and ideas. These people have collectively started to refer to one another as <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Issues/Torture/Call/Individuals/Militarygrade.pdf">Targeted Individuals or TI’s</a> and often refer to the symptoms of psychological weapon attacks as a form of <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Issues/Torture/Call/Individuals/Militarygrade.pdf">‘Gang Stalking’</a> as its often believed that its perpetrated by a group of individuals<a href="#bib-51">[51]</a>. These people report the experience of these weapons to be akin to pure psychological torture. The communities discuss a variety of technologies that are being used on them and have collectively <a href="https://www.ohchr.org/sites/default/files/Documents/Issues/Torture/Call/Individuals/Militarygrade.pdf">classified them into a few categories</a><a href="#bib-51">[51]</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>DEWs (Direct Energy Weapons)</strong> - Weapons that cause similar effects as the Havana Syndrome: people report headaches and migraines, tinnitus, burns to their skin, nausea, unnatural stimulations around their body.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>V2K (Voice to Skull)</strong> - Technology that can communicate voices directly to people’s heads. People report a variety of ways these voices communicate with individuals but overall, the communications are extremely negative, and extremely psychologically distressing. They encourage violence, suicide, and horrific acts. Some people attest that the voices sometimes seem generated by AI or an LLM designed specifically to damage their minds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Remote BCI or RNM</strong> - (bidirectional computing interfaces, or a device that allows your thoughts to be read and interpreted by computers, and for computers to write back to your thoughts) also known as Remote Neural Monitoring or RNM.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these technologies that people claim are being used on them, are discussed as developmental objectives in the above military reports from Timothy L. Thomas.</p>
<p>To inform on the nature of these experiences, on the next few pages are some sample descriptions taken from the hundreds of thousands posted on Reddit, where a large portion of people experiencing this communicate.</p>

<h4 id="scope-of-the-issue">Scope of the Issue<a href="#scope-of-the-issue" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h4>
<p>This is not a small phenomenon. There are thousands of online communities, millions of victim testimonies, advocacy groups, charities, associations, live meetings, in person and online support groups, and international associations world wide dedicated to all aspects of this experience. The people reporting these symptoms include <a href="https://targetedjustice.com/board-%26-advisory-board">doctors</a>, <a href="https://substack.com/@voicuantonalbu">engineers</a>, scholars, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Gangstalking/comments/v3u8xn/college/">college students</a>, <a href="https://barbarahartwell.blogspot.com/">whistleblowers</a> and people from all walks of life<a href="#bib-57">[57]</a><a href="#bib-58">[58]</a><a href="#bib-59">[59]</a>. For example, the <a href="https://targetedjustice.com/board-%26-advisory-board">board and advisory board directors of Targeted Justice</a>, a 501(c)(3) human rights organization dedicated to ending the use of these weapons, includes medical doctors, engineers, ex-nasa employees, and neuroscientists<a href="#bib-57">[57]</a>. Another example includes High Energy Particle Physicist <a href="https://stop007.org/home/about/">Dr. Katherin Horton who is married to Former NSA Technical Director Bill Binney</a>, who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COJi50XXvbo&amp;t=2s">claims neurotechnology and direct energy weapons have been used to torture her for decades</a><a href="#bib-60">[60]</a><a href="#bib-61">[61]</a>.</p>
<p>The next few sections comprise a body of evidence to demonstrate the size of this issue and substantiate the above statements. There are thousands of websites and online communities world wide discussing the issue of people being subjected to psychological weapon attacks. People have tried to draw attention to the matter with hundreds of petitions that have gained thousands of signatures. There have been an extreme number of lawsuits alleging that these weapons exist and are being used on people. There are numerous books on the matter claiming the existence of these weapons. There are people who have committed violent crimes that have testified it was because they were under psychological weapon torture. There are also a sizable number of whistleblowers who have directly expressed that these weapons exist and are being used on people. This collection is only intended to inform of the size of the issue not provide a complete collection.</p>
<h4 id="websites-and-online-communities">Websites and Online Communities<a href="#websites-and-online-communities" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h4>
<p>Here are a small subset of the online communities dedicated to this issue to draw attention to how large this phenomenon is. Given the overwhelming quantity of websites, social media groups, videos, and posts on this topic, a conservative estimate of people experiencing this in the United States may be around one hundred thousand people evidenced by the hundreds of facebook groups with tens of thousands of members, the tens of thousands of videos available across Youtube, Tiktok, Vimeo, Instagram and the collective body of millions of online posts.</p>

<p><strong>Advances in Tesla Technology by Dr. Nick Begich and Jeane Manning</strong></p>
<p>“The U.S. Government has a new ground-based ―Star Wars weapon which is being tested in the remote bush country of Alaska. This new system manipulates the environment in a way which can: Disrupt human mental processes.”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“External stimulation of the brain by electromagnetic means can cause the brain to be entrained or locked into phase with an external signal generator. Predominant brain waves can be driven or pushed into new frequency patterns by external stimulation. In other words, the external signal driver or impulse generator entrains the brain, overriding the normal frequencies causing changes in the brain waves; which then cause changes in brain chemistry; which then cause changes in brain outputs in the form of thoughts, emotions or physical condition. As you are driven, so you arrive - brain manipulation can be either beneficial or detrimental to the individual being impacted”</p>

<p><strong>1996 by Gloria Naylor</strong></p>
<p>“Ms. GLORIA NAYLOR (Author): Since many of these things did happen to the real Gloria Naylor, by using myself as a protagonist, I was able to have the book act partly as a catharsis. Basically, what 1996 is about, it’s about our loss of privacy in this country, that the government has moved well beyond just the simple following of people, and the tapping of their phones. But they now have technology that is able to decode the brain patterns, and to detect what people are actually thinking. And they have another technology called microwave hearing, where they can actually input words into your head, bypassing your ears.”</p>

<p>“I hear unusual sounds round-the-clock: in the toilet, in the prayer, during talks, and in every activity. Apart from the waves, the mind controller conducts round-the-clock harassment by directing to do odd things. Whenever I take rest or hold conversations, I am deliberately made to lose temper and as a result, I get angry with the person I am talking to. The restlessness means that I am forever deprived of a peaceful moment. The agony, anger, hatred and worry keep hurting and haunting me. This technique has curbed my personal joviality and feeling; it has prevented me from thinking as an individual. This has made my life monotonous and dull. I find difficulty in expressing my sadness especially at the circumstances prevailing in the country, particularly the way the country is being ruled. Nevertheless, I still do not hesitate to raise my voice against the tyranny.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Nevada Electronic Torture Act</strong></p>
<p>“A corrupt organization centrally coordinates an abundant of crimes against an individuals’ knowing and willingly course of conduct that inflicts extreme and inhumane pain and suffering on a specific person by impetuously and covertly inflicting grave bodily injury for the rest of the victim’s life. These injuries are mostly imperceptible or often seem to have naturally occurred and are perpetrated in such a sophisticated and malicious method as to render the victim’s torture complaint perceived as delusional or paranoid. Prior to the enactment of this chapter, the police and federal agencies have instantaneously dismissed the victim’s complainants presumptuous that the victims are delusional or paranoid and are mistakenly detaining the victim’s in psychiatric institutions for observation. Electronic Torturing has a major influence on an individual’s health; it can cause memory loss which transforms into early Alzheimer’s, and attributes into cell damage of the brain.”</p>

<p><strong>United States: Sens. Cantwell, Schumer, Markey Introduce Legislation to Shield Americans’ Brain Data From Exploitation</strong></p>
<p>“As technology continues to develop at a rapid pace, it is vital that we balance innovation with safety and privacy. Neural data is some of the most private and sensitive information we can imagine—our innermost thoughts and emotions,” said Leader Schumer. “For example, data about a person’s brain activity could be misused to push manipulative ads or high-risk financial schemes designed to take advantage of consumers at their most vulnerable moments. We must ensure that Americans know how this data is being collected and used, that their consent matters, and that strong guardrails are in place so innovation serves people—not exploits them. The MIND Act is an important step forward to begin taking action in this area—but it also highlights the need for a comprehensive privacy framework that sets strong, lasting safeguards for all Americans.”</p>

<p>From the discussion above, we know that Directed Energy Weapons commonly referred to as DEWs certainly exist. It is documented that the Russians were using electromagnetic weapons to cause a range of negative physiological <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3509929/">effects as early as 1953</a> and the Havana Syndrome/ AHI’s are confirmed by experts from a range of different fields to have been most likely caused by direct pulsed radio-frequency energy<a href="#bib-284">[284]</a>.</p>
<p>As to remote neural monitoring and voice to skull technology, there are United States Military Engineers who have confessed it exists. In 2002, Navy Scientist Dr. Eldon Byrd an <a href="https://www.psychotronics.org/scalar-technologies-by-eldon-byrd-a-masterclass-on-scalar-waves/">“an expert in the biological effects of extremely low-frequency magnetic fields”</a>, discussed his research and his knowledge of research regarding “Mind Control Weapons” at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqPIdYRZkKE">United States Psychotronics Association Conference</a><a href="#bib-285">[285]</a><a href="#bib-286">[286]</a>. His personal statement that has gained notoriety in the community is as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Is Mind Control Possible? Absolutely. There is a mountain of evidence... Today we know there are technologies that can induce sound into the brain at a distance, can monitor and alter brainwaves at a distance, can alter behavior at a distance, can induce images into the brain at a distance, can target individual organs at a distance. Can disrupt the calcium ions binding on individual cell surfaces at a distance, creating pain and other effects anywhere in the body. Mind control technology exists, without a question.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an earlier report, in 1972 American scientists had established at the University Research level that remote brain monitoring and remote brain stimulation was possible via implants. Consider these excerpts from the paper by <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/42909755">Barton L. Ingraham and Gerald W. titled “The Use of Electronics in the Observation and Control of Human Behavior and Its Possible Use in Rehabilitation and Parole” released in Issues in Criminology volume 7</a><a href="#bib-287">[287]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“One of the leaders in the field of internal radio-telemetry devices is Mackay (1961). He has developed devices which he calls “endoradiosondes.” These are tiny transmitters that can be swallowed or implanted internally in man or animal. They have been designed in order to measure and transmit such physiological variables as gastrointestinal pressure, blood pressure, body temperature, bioelectrical potentials (voltage accompanying the functioning of the brain, the heart and other muscles), oxygen levels, acidity and radiation intensity (Mackay, 1965). In fact, in many cases for the purposes of biomedical and physiological research, internal telemetry is the only way of obtaining the desired data. In the case where the body functions do not emit electrical energy (as the brain, heart and other neuromuscular structures do), these devices have been ingeniously modified in order to measure changes in pressure, acidity, etc., and to transmit electrical signals reflecting these changes to receivers outside the body. In this case the transmitters are called “transducers.” Both “active” and “passive” transmitters have been developed, “active” transmitters containing a battery powering an oscillator, and “passive” transmitters not containing an internal power source, but having instead tuned circuits modulated from an outside power source. Although “passive” systems enjoy the advantage of not being concerned with power failure or battery replacement, they do not put out as good a signal as an “active” system. Both transmitter systems, at present, have ranges of a few feet to a dozen- just enough to bring out the signal from inside the body (Mackay, 1965). Thus, it is generally necessary for the subject to carry a small booster transmitter in order to receive the weak signal from inside the body and increase its strength for rebroadcasting to a remote laboratory or data collection point.point. However, with the development of integrated circuits, both transmitters and boosters can be miniaturized to a fantastic degree.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, as of 1972, researchers and scientists were seemingly well aware of devices that could monitor the brain and other physiological telemetry and some of these devices could be implanted or simply swallowed… Furthermore:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The technique employed in electrophysiology in studying the brain of animals and man by stimulating its different areas electrically is nothing new. This technique was being used by two European physiologists, Fritsch and Hitzig, on dogs in the latter half of the of the 19th Century. (Sheer, 1961; Krech, 1966). In fact, much of the early work in experimental psychology was devoted to physiological studies of the human nervous system. During the last twenty years, however, – perhaps as a result of equipment which allows the implantation of electrodes deep in the subcortical regions of the brian and the brain stem by stereotaxic instruments– the science of electrophysiology has received new impetus, and our understanding of neural activity within the brain and its behavioral and experiential correlates has been greatly expanded.</p>
<p>The electrical stimulation of various areas of the brain has produced a wide range of phenomena in animals and humans. An examination of published research in electrical stimulation of the brain suggests two crude methods of controlling human behavior: (1) by “blocking” of the response, through the production of fear, anxiety, disorientation, loss of memory and purpose, and even, if need be, by loss of consciousness; and (2) through conditioning behavior by the manipulation of rewarding and aversive stimuli (Jones, 1965).”</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>“The use, then, of telemetric systems as a method of monitoring man, of obtaining physiological data from his body and nervous system, and of stimulating his brain electrically from a distance, seems in the light of present research entirely feasible and possible as means of control.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As evidenced above, the US knew as of 1972 that it was possible to use devices that could potentially be swallowed or implanted in other ways, to remotely monitor and stimulate someone’s brain in a variety of ways to cause a range of emotional and behavioral effects. This idea of Remote Neural Monitoring (RNM), the symptoms that millions of online posts are reporting today, existed as it was being actively studied by American researchers as of 1972.</p>
<p>We also have direct documentation from senior Foreign Military Studies Office analyst, Timothy L. Thomas, in his reports ‘The Mind Has No Firewall’ and ‘Human Network Attacks’, discussed in above sections, that the Russians and Chinese were developing psychological weapons that could read brain waves and states from a distance, and transmit voices and ideas into people’s heads as early as 1991.</p>
<p>There is more evidence attesting to these technologies’ existence. Other credible examples are listed below.</p>

<pre><code>* “Directed Acoustics
</code></pre>
<p>In Maoist China, cities were equipped with megaphones, bombarding the people with on-going propaganda. The megaphones were in full vision of the people, yet there was no way to escape the sound. Today technology exists that fills a similar purpose. Voice to Skull directed acoustic devices are neuro-electromagnetic non-lethal weapons that can produce sounds within the skull of a human.”</p>
<pre><code>* “Despite Clinton’s reforms on human testing, the government, military and the corporation will undoubtedly want to test these weapons on humans whenever possible. Easiest to test would be prisoners in undisclosed CIA detention centers, civilians in war torn regions, and even US citizens in protest crowds or civilian jails. In addition to the rubber bullets and pepper spray, which are common in many police forces, new concept weapons are also in use. Perhaps soon Americans will learn firsthand, the effects of the new human control technologies.  
</code></pre>
<p>However, hundreds of people continue to assert that a person or persons, whom they do not know, have been targeting them with electromagnetic weapons in a widespread campaign of either illegal</p>
<p>experimentation or outright persecution.</p>
<p>These experiences involved a number of discrete phenomena:</p>
<pre><code>  * Hearing voices when no one was present.

  * Feeling sensations of burning, itching, tickling, or pressure with no apparent physical cause.

  * Sleeplessness and anxiety as a result of “humming” or “buzzing”. Loss of bodily control, such as twitching or jerking of an arm or leg suddenly and without control.

  * Unexpected emotional states, such as a sudden overwhelming feeling of dread, rage, lust or sorrow that passes as quickly as it arises.”

* “Any device that invades a persons mind, either through induction of “evoked potentials” through electromagnetic means or through the various “crazy-making” tactics employed in both information warfare and psychological operations is a violation of human rights and cognitive liberty.”

<p>…</p>
<p>The authors state, “The brain-computer interface can be</p>
<p>attacked by hackers and used to counter the wearer of the brain-computer interface, such as stimulating specific brain areas in a malicious way.” Specifically, the authors envision “a paragraph of text, a sentence, an expression, a behavior, etc., [and,] after being implanted in the human brain, it quickly replicates itself and destroys the normal cognition of the human brain by manipulating its behavior, will, and beliefs.””</p>
<pre><code>*  **pg. 56:** “Another key ambition for future PLA [ China’s Peoples Liberation Army ] psychological warfare is to be able to externally influence or even control adversary cognitive function, via (often electrical) stimuli and thus decisionmaking and even physical actions. Although this is not a new idea within the PLA, it appears to have gained prominence under the cognitive domain operations concept. Variously referred to as brain control (控制大脑, 控脑, or 制脑), consciousness intervention (意识干预), psychological intervention (心理干预), cognitive control (认知控制 or 控制认知), thought control (意念控制), neurological control (神经控制), cognitive manipulation (认知操控 or 认知操纵), cognitive interference (认知干扰), and psychological manipulation (心理操控), the objective is to neutralize the enemy (specific soldiers) via (usually) nonlethal attacks. Common objectives include forcing others to change orders, lay down weapons, surrender, and even commit suicide. Common tactics include causing psychological damage, confusion, hallucinations, seizures, and incapacitation. Specific technologies cited for this application include lasers, electromagnetic weapons, microwaves, drugs, sonic weapons, and holograms. All of these are old ideas within PLA psychological warfare circles but appear to be gaining renewed interest.

<p>PLA literature touts a range of capabilities as part of this vision. One article categorized these capabilities as “acoustic weapons, laser weapons, radio frequency directed disabling weapons [射频定向失能武器], and chemical disabling weapons [化学失能性武器].”203 Microwave weapons are also mentioned. For example, one 2015 China Military Science article argues that “biological effects research” (生物效应研究) will greatly improve nonlethal new concept weapons (非致命新概念武器), perhaps making war more moral.204 Such capabilities, as listed by the author, include millimeter-wave active denial weapons (毫米波主动拒止武器), sonic weapons, laser blinding weapons (激光致僵武器), and brain control weapons (控脑武器), some of which the author claims have already been used by the U.S. military or are otherwise under development.”</p>
<pre><code>*  **pg 61:** “Other applications are “brain interference” (脑干扰) and “information damage” (信息损害). Brain interference here is defined as “controlling [someone’s] thoughts and behavior . . . [via] collecting the brain waves of a specific target; analyzing their frequency, amplitude, and other characteristics; and then transmitting specific electrical waves . . . to influence and change the brain waves of a specific target.” PLA researchers believe that the United States is already working on, and has even already employed, these brain control weapons. Zeng argues in his 2017 PLA Daily article that the applicability to warfare has been identified and already developed by the United States and other countries. He points to a 2012 Royal Society report arguing that cognitive neuroscience can be weaponized to develop weapons that directly target the nervous system. He also says that a purported DoD document, “Defense Science and Technology Development Plan 2013–2017,” “suggests that a disruptive application of cognitive neuroscience (including brain science) holds the promise of neurobiological warfare [神经生物战] for thought disruption and control [思维干 扰与控制]” and that the United States has even used such brain control weapons (控脑武器) in the Iraq War.215 Zeng adds that the U.S. military is currently developing “consciousness intervention weapons [意识干预武器], phantom vision weapons [幻视武器], and phantom“hearing weapons [幻听武器].” Zeng predicts that future development of these systems will be even more nonlethal and more precise. Wu cites a 2018 U.S. Army–affiliated study on automatic information operations as evidence the United States is already working on shaping adversary behavior.

<p>Similarly, the 2017 National Defense article authors cite a litany of U.S. (and European and Russian) government and military efforts.219 These date back to unspecified 2003 DoD planning; work on BCI since 2010; President Barack Obama’s 2013 comments about the importance of the “human brain project” and a DoD 2013–2017 national defense science and technology development plan that includes cognitive neuroscience, nanoscience, synthetic biology, and computer modeling of human behavior; and the “Strong Brain Project,” which focuses on simulating the cerebral cortex for controlling their willpower.</p>

<p>PLA psychological warfare texts reveal a Chinese approach to psychological warfare that has not dramatically changed from what the United States was observed doing in Iraq in 2003 or even what the PLA envisioned in 2001.”</p>
<p>With the Moscow Embassy attacks of 1953, the Havana Syndrome attacks of the past decade and a half, research papers expressing that remote neural monitoring and remote brain manipulation was already possible with contemporary technology as of the early 1970s, military reports documenting Russian and Chinese research objectives that included reading minds from a distance, communicating voices into people’s minds, and causing mental health disorders as of the early 1990s, US military scientists attesting that mind control technology in its entirety existed as of 2002, numerous other reports from University Researchers attesting to the existence of these technologies, all the other examples listed above attesting to the development and existence of this technology and at the very least hundreds of thousands of civilians in the US and worldwide across millions of social media posts claiming these technologies are being used on them **** there is enough evidence to conclude the following:</p>

<p>The next section explores the public perception of who is using this technology. It provides further social evidence that these technologies exist by mentioning several whistleblowers testimony.</p>
<h4 id="who-is-perpetrating-the-use-of-this-technology">Who is perpetrating the use of this technology?<a href="#who-is-perpetrating-the-use-of-this-technology" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h4>
<p>Presented above is the theory that US citizens may be under attack from foreign adversaries. However, there is an additional element to this problem. Viewing the websites listed above, and investigating what is being claimed on them reveals a variety of assertions on who is perpetrating these attacks and why. Popular amidst these claims is the view of Targeted Justice, that people in the United States experiencing these symptoms are victims of US Legal institutions.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.targetedjustice.com">https://www.targetedjustice.com</a><a href="#bib-63">[63]</a></p>
<p>“It all starts at the FBI…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The TSDB was created in 2004 as a reaction to the 9/11 false flag. It consolidated 14 terrorist lists spread among different agencies into one, and vested the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) with the authority to maintain it.</p>
<p>It is not a tool to combat terrorism. It is a roster of the CIA government weaponization.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From Targeted Massachusetts:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.targetedmassachusetts.org/">https://www.targetedmassachusetts.org/</a><a href="#bib-64">[64]</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The CIA has consistently lied to the American public about anomalous health incidents (AHI) for the last several years and may be guilty of obstruction of justice, according to documents recently released by the U.S. government.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is further evidenced by the list of lawsuit defendants mentioned in the “[The Public’s Battle with Psychological Weapons](<a href="http://The">http://The</a> Public’s Battle With Psychological Weapons)” section above<a href="#bib-290">[290]</a>. That US intelligence or law enforcement agencies are perpetrating these crimes against US civilians certainly is a possibility that people going through this have to consider. After all, with operations like <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/COINTELPRO">CointelPro by the FBI</a>, <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/MK-ULTRA">MKUltra by the CIA</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_Committee">Church Hearings</a>, and the <a href="https://intelligence.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=1486">National Intelligence Council’s recent actions of withholding information from the public around the Havana Syndrome attacks,</a> it’s not unreasonable for civilians to think that our government agencies may be involved in these operations<a href="#bib-31">[31]</a><a href="#bib-291">[291]</a><a href="#bib-292">[292]</a><a href="#bib-293">[293]</a>. Additionally, the aforementioned paper <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/42909755">“The Use of Electronics in the Observation and Control of Human Behavior and Its Possible Use in Rehabilitation and Parole”</a> directly states that remote neural monitoring implants should be used in the United States for law enforcement purposes<a href="#bib-287">[287]</a>.</p>
<p>This notion is substantiated by numerous whistleblower reports; consider Ted Gunderson who in <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-02-22-me-10623-story.html">1977 was appointed head of the Los Angeles FBI</a><a href="#bib-294">[294]</a>. Here is <a href="https://archive.org/details/ted-gunderson-affidavit_202407/mode/2up">his personal testimony in a lawsuit involving a man named Kieth Labella against the FBI alleging gang stalking</a><a href="#bib-295">[295]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“I have read the Complaint in the current action of Mr. Keith Labella against F.B.I. and D.O.J. It is my professional opinion, based on information, knowledge and belief that the information sought by Mr. Labella in this F.O.I.A. suit regarding “gang stalking”, “gang stalking groups” and “gang stalking methods” reasonably describes an ongoing, active, covert nationwide program that is in effect today, and, based on my investigations and experience, has been operational since at least the early 1980’s. Since the 1980’s gang stalking has increased in scope, intensity and sophistication by adapting to new communications and surveillance technology. These programs are using the codenames Echelon Program, Carnivore System, and Tempest Systems. The Echelon Program is administered by the N.S.A. out of Fort Meade, Maryland, and monitors all email and phone calls in the world. Carnivore System is administered by the N.S.A. out of Fort Meade, Maryland, and can download any computer system without being traced or otherwise known to the owner. Tempest Systems can decipher what is on any computer screen up to a quarter of mile away. These programs are negatively impacting, thousands of Americans and severely abusing their civil rights on a daily basis.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In addition to Gunderson’s testimony, there are many other ex-law-enforcement, ex-intelligence, and ex-military whistleblowers making similar assertions. Ted Giffen is one of the countless US citizens claiming psychological weapon torture who have tried time and time again to take <a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCOURTS-caed-1_14-cv-01280/pdf/USCOURTS-caed-1_14-cv-01280-4.pdf">legal action against various entities in the US to stop his pain</a><a href="#bib-254">[254]</a>. In <a href="https://everydayconcerned.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/investigative-reporter-statement-by-ramola-d-for-todd-giffen.pdf">an official statement</a> on the validity of his claims to try to help his case, investigative reporter Ramola Dharmaraj collected statements from various whistleblowers, doctors, scientists, that all attest to the existence and use of this technology<a href="#bib-296">[296]</a>.</p>
<p>Here are their statements:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Barbara Hartwell, CIA Whistle-blower, Independent Investigator, Intelligence Analyst, Journalist/ Letter from Barbara Hartwell for Ramola D</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“It is a well-known and prolifically documented fact that such electro-magnetic weaponry exists and has been operational for decades, used by the military and intelligence agencies (including but not limited to FBI, CIA, NSA, DIA, DARPA) against persons deemed “dissidents,” whistleblowers, journalists and expositors of vital information which should be of concern to every American who values the God-given, unalienable rights and liberties enshrined in the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution, and specifically the Bill of Rights contained therein….I am one of many former intelligence professionals, an independent investigator, intelligence analyst and journalist, who, for more than a quarter century, has been documenting and publicly reporting on the high-tech anti-personnel weaponry used against us.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dr. Rauni Kilde, former Chief Medical Officer of Finland</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“Technology in the public-demain is at least 50 years behind the technologies in the hands of secret services and militaries. Implants were used by CIA in 1952, now implants in hands are used in 2000 to open doors, garages. Back in 1975, Russian foreign minister Gromyko reported that the subject of psychotronic or non-lethal weapons being a weapon of mass destruction was brought up in the UN and many countries agreed they should be banned, but the US did not.Militaries and secret services have always secretly experimented on people—it is absolutely criminal.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>NSA Intelligence Analyst Karen Melton-Stewart (Retd.)/Letter from Karen Stewart for Ramola D</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“The high-tech, covert technology to which Mrs. Dharmaraj refers, has been used secretly for decades against our enemies when overt actions were simply too risky…I will tell you that I have been working closely with Ramola Dharmaraj for almost two years and am quite impressed with her multifaceted talent, integrity, superior intellect, brilliant writing capability and exceptional research ability. What she is telling you about highly advanced, covert technology being used on “inconvenient” people, people of integrity (whistle-blowers), truth-tellers (certain journalists), activists, potential leaders in a community, independent and aware thinkers, patriots, and Constitutionalists, as a means to intimidate, isolate, torture, murder and “make examples of” them to the general population, is 100% True…”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>FBI Special Agent, Attorney, Judge Geral Sosbee (Retd.)</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“The FBI is spearheading the most colossal and evil attacks on people ever conceived on the face of the Earth, and they are using Deep Space-based technology, they are using Bio-Chemical Viral Warfare Elements and Agents, and they’re using Psychological Warfare to destroy people.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong>Robert Duncan, Ph.D, DOD/CIA Scientist, Cybernetics &amp; Artificial Intelligence, Author, The Matrix Deciphered, Project Soulcatcher</strong></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“The military applications were quite transparent. I worked on the AI (artificial intelligence) natural language responses. They are broadly called “chatter-bots”. They are useful in occupation of the target mind for disablement, NLP (neural linguistic programming), and interrogation....The CIA formerly used mostly LSD and other substances that would perform similar functions....A weapon more powerful than the atomic bomb for influencing populations is quite sought after by many countries. It is another arms race. When weapons are “field tested” they need to be very secretive. The database for the probability matrices of the efficacy on each culture and language needs to be done for improvements, development,and evolution of the AI system. Doing it world-wide is necessary for other reasons too.”</p>

<p>“The brain is the next battlespace…. We are targeting the brain…. Like (in) any race, the morbidity and mortality, going at this speed, with this level of integrity and this level of momentum, is real. We are tracking neurological or brain signatures of key targeted individuals that are thought to represent whole groups....I can utilize neuro-pharmacologics and various forms of brain stimulation to extract information from key intelligence targets....TITAN (Tiered-integrated Tracking and Access Networks) utilizes biologically-implantable chips to track key individuals and provide information about the way brains work to create narratives and behaviors....In Europe, the Nutfield Council of Bioethics said we are getting very close to weaponizing the brain sciences and in a year it would be ready for use. In 2014, the NAS reconvened and made the announcement that the brain sciences are now ready and are currently being used in such endeavors in the US and worldwide. So we are moving into the operational space. I.e., it is being used....High-output sensory stimulators (can be administered by UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles), drones, or insect borne, or by large vehicles; cars, or tanks). These use sensory mobilizing agents that use high electromagnetic pulse energy that may also use high levels of sound and light energy and they disrupt neuro sensory functions. These are being used.”</p>

<p>In yet another example, David Voigts, a formal naval officer, has issued a public statement and is conducting a <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/No-Touch-Torture">fundraising campaign</a> to draw awareness to the use of this technology<a href="#bib-154">[154]</a>. Here is a statement from his campaign page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘My name is David Voigts. I’m a former naval officer and a graduate of the United States Naval Academy. I have a degree in Control Systems Engineering and served in Electronics Warfare and nuclear engineering jobs as a Surface Warfare Officer. While in the service I became aware of ongoing non-consensual human experimentation.</p>
<p>The program is studying human-machine interface weaponry, and the technology is used in psychological warfare, harassment, discrediting, and revenge campaigns. The Targeted Individual program is a domestic torture program aimed at unsuspecting US citizens.</p>
<p>I have been doing public outreach for two years now, and there have been quite a few topical news stories that have published since I started my outreach.</p>
<p>First, the revelations about organized harassment perpetrated by certain groups in the Church of Scientology match the harassment campaigns aimed at Targeted Individuals.</p>
<p>Pulitzer Prize-winning author Lawrence Wright covered the topic in his New Yorker article “The Apostate” as well as his book “Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief” - which became a documentary film “Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief.” ‘</p>

<p>If there were in fact institutions in the United States perpetrating these crimes, as the reports above testify, the legal ramifications would be profound regardless of their rationale. To gain an understanding of the legal violations involved with this notion, here is an excerpt from Chat GPT on the matter:</p>
<hr>
<p>“If what you describe were happening — that is, <strong>a U.S. government agency conducting nonconsensual experiments on civilians involving psychological and neurological torture</strong> — it would violate <strong>numerous U.S. and international laws, constitutional protections, and human rights conventions</strong>.

<p>If this were true, the rights of United States civilians have been violated in a multitude of ways and the legal protections that are supposed to have been afforded to them by the US Justice system and constitution have been ignored. Given the above evidence, the historical precedent of the United States conducting illegal experimentation and social interruption programs on its civilians and the testimony from members of the CIA, FBI, Navy, and countless experts, this possibility cannot be immediately denied.</p>
<p>Here is a supporting quote from the **<a href="https://www.projectcensored.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/ElectromegnaticWeapons.pdf">US Electromagnetic Weapons and Human Rights 2006</a> **paper mentioned above<a href="#bib-288">[288]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“For the US Government to unilaterally declare that our country will not comply with international human rights laws, nor uphold the core values of our nation’s foundation is an indication of extremism that supersedes the values and beliefs of the American people. When such extremism exists we need to take seriously the founders’ declaration that, “ to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.” (Declaration of Independence 1776) ”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, with this reality in mind, it is important to consider a very plausible counterpoint. The perception that these attack are being conducted by institutions within the US strongly benefits U.S. foreign adversaries. Purposely turning a nation inward on itself, establishing massive distrust in the government and law enforcement agencies etc. damages the reputation of a country with its own civilians and weakens the nations morale. It stands that this could be a result of psychological warfare operations conducted by Russia or China given the earlier discussion on their development of ‘psy weapons’, objectives to conduct peacetime offensives, and the fact that they have used types of psychotronic weapons on US civilians before. See section <a href="https://concernedcitizen1953.substack.com/i/177690685/modern-day-psychological-attacks-on-americans">Modern Day Psychological Attacks on Americans</a><a href="#bib-298">[298]</a>.</p>
<p>What other theories are there? This is being reported en mass in both the US and countless other nations worldwide. Is this a new form of psychological warfare that all established governments are using on each other? Is this the work of criminal organizations hired by private companies to silence whistleblowers as former Naval officer David Voigts suggested about the Church of Scientology and countless lawsuits alleged against companies like State Farm, Facebook, and Ford? It is easy to imagine that if this technology has been developed, then criminal enterprises could be able to obtain it as well. With all of these possibilities in mind, it certainly stands that the perpetrators could be a variety of governments, institutions, companies and criminal syndicates each utilizing them for a multitude of their own objectives.</p>
<p>Above all, with the sheer quantity of American citizens reporting this phenomenon, and the evidence established over the course of this research that this these weapons abuses are a possibility, this warrants an extensive investigation. By the evidence above, American Lives are being severely impacted by a phenomenon that aligns with psychotronic weapon development and abuse. In the next section is an additional element of this phenomenon.</p>

<p>Another aspect of the victimization of those who believe they are experiencing these attacks is the doubt cast on their experiences by the <a href="https://scholarworks.smith.edu/theses/702/">Medical community.</a> The medical community does not have a framework to diagnose when someone is experiencing the effects of advanced weapons as evidenced by the Havana Syndrome, and discussed below<a href="#bib-299">[299]</a>. Professional often deny the reports of these victims rationalizing them in delusion or psychogenic illness. For example, examine the reaction by the medical community to the Havana Attacks and AHI victims:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/its-catching/202110/evidence-mounts-mass-suggestion-caused-havana-syndrome?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Robert Bartholomew, Ph.D</a><a href="#bib-300">[300]</a></p>
<p>“The contents of two U.S. government investigations into the origins of the ‘<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/havana-syndrome-symptoms-11626882951">Havana Syndrome</a>‘ both found that mass psychogenic illness was likely a major driver of the outbreak<a href="#bib-301">[301]</a>.”</p>
<p><a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10913303/">National Library of Medicine: Havana Syndrome”: A post mortem</a><a href="#bib-302">[302]</a></p>
<p>“Contemporary examples include health worries involving mobile phones, Wi-Fi, 5G, and wind turbines. “Havana Syndrome” is just the latest in a long list of health scares. In October 2021, the U.S. Congress passed a law authorizing financial compensation for government victims of “Havana Syndrome.” This is reminiscent of past decisions to award compensation for dubious conditions such as “railway spine” in the U.K. (Gasquoine, 2020) and “telephone sickness” in German switchboard operators (Killen, 2003).”</p>

<p>“Delusional disorder in the DSM-5 is described as an inaccurate interpretation of external reality despite evidence on the contrary; the belief is incongruent with one’s culture or subculture.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Additionally, per <a href="https://www.congress.gov/118/meeting/house/117249/witnesses/HHRG-118-HM05-Wstate-EdgreenG-20240508.pdf">Greg Edgreen’s testimony</a> at the House Havana Attack Hearing the victims of the discussed Moscow Embassy attacks that occurred from the 1950’s to the 1970’s were accused of being delusional as well<a href="#bib-24">[24]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Again, the survivors were accused of mass hysteria and told nothing about the causes of their symptoms, until the government finally informed the staff in 1976 at a confidential meeting.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It has often been the case throughout recent history that people undergoing covert psychological manipulation, whether it be by government experiments, psychological operations, or psychological weapons, have been further victimized by diagnoses of medical disorders like schizophrenia, delusional disorders and other mental health conditions.</p>
<h4 id="the-cias-mkultra-experiments">The CIA’s MKUltra Experiments<a href="#the-cias-mkultra-experiments" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h4>
<p>Consider the victims of the MKUltra experiments by the CIA. Here is MKUltra described by Lucas J. Meier in his discussion paper ‘<a href="https://www.hks.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/2025-01/24_Meier_02.pdf">Mind Control: Past and Future</a>’<a href="#bib-304">[304]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“During the Cold-War-era, intelligence agencies in both the Eastern and Western blocs set up secret experiments to devise methods of mind control and brainwashing in order to gain an advantage over the enemy. The most notorious of these endeavours was the Central Intelligence Agency’s (CIA) illegal MKUltra program, which ran from 1953 to 1973. In its quest for a truth serum that could be employed to force confessions from subjects who are not cooperating and the desire to be able to manipulate people’s behaviour, the CIA experimented on thousands of subjects – partly without their knowledge or consent, and often with disastrous consequences.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/MK-ULTRA">Brittanica’s page on MK-ULTRA</a> on the experimentation of LSD<a href="#bib-292">[292]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“It was also used heavily on prisoners, mentally ill people, and people experiencing addiction—“people who could not fight back,” as one CIA officer put it.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Posing a theoretical scenario, if one were a victim of these experiments, would visiting a medical Doctor would help you? What would telling a doctor that one suspects they have been experimented on by the government, or a hospital, or a prison, result in? Consider the following case:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Frank Olson – Army civilian biochemist</p>
<p>“The most tragic result of the testing of LSD by the CIA was the death of Dr. Frank Olson, a civilian employee of the Army, who died. on November 27, 1953. His death followed his participation in a CIA experiment with LSD. As part of this experiment, Olson unwittingly received approximately 70 micrograms of LSD in a glass of Cointreau he drank on November 19, 1953. The drug had been placed in the bottle by a CIA officer, Dr. Robert Lashbrook, as part of an experiment he and Dr. Sidney Gottlieb performed at a meeting of Army and CIA scientists. Shortly after this experiment, Olson exhibited symptoms of paranoia and schizophrenia. Accompanied by Dr. Lashbrook, Olson sought psychiatric assistance in New York City from a physician, Dr. Harold Abramson.”</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Frank Olson, as a result of being experimented on, exhibited symptoms of paranoia and schizophrenia. He was advised to enter a sanitarium because of the severity of these so-called delusions. This should be recognized as an additional component of being victimized by these psychological attacks.</p>
<h4 id="zersetzung">Zersetzung<a href="#zersetzung" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h4>
<p>In another instance, consider a government psychological repression program titled Zersetzung operated by the East Germany secret police, or Stasi, from the 1960’s to the 1980’s. <a href="https://www.historyhit.com/the-stasi-the-most-terrifying-secret-police-in-history/">The Stasi’s objective</a> was as follows<a href="#bib-307">[307]</a>: “the aim [was] keeping the government informed and being able to quash any discontent before it became a threat”. However, this involved severe tactics. Zersetzung,<a href="https://www.zersetzung.info/"> literally meaning ‘decomposition’</a>, was designed to secretly and psychologically sabotage people’s lives without a trace<a href="#bib-308">[308]</a>. Here’s a description of Zersetzung by <a href="https://www.uniklinikum-jena.de/sedgesundheitsfolgen/en/Glossary/Decomposition%2Bof%2Bpersonalities.html">the German University Hospital Jena</a><a href="#bib-309">[309]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘the “systematic discrediting of public reputation, reputation and prestige on the basis of interconnected true, verifiable discrediting as well as untrue, credible, irrefutable and thus also discrediting information” or the “systematic organization of professional and social failures to undermine self-confidence”.’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the paper ‘<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/321856284_From_Hohenschonhausen_to_Guantanamo_Bay_Psychology%27s_role_in_the_secret_services_of_the_GDR_and_the_United_States">From Hohenschönhausen to Guantanamo Bay: Psychology’s role in the secret services of the GDR and the United States’ by Moritz Michels and Martin Weiser</a> published in the ‘Journal of the History of Behavioral Sciences’ is the following description on how this operation was intentionally crafted by expert psychologists to take advantage of and manipulate the human mind<a href="#bib-310">[310]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>‘In 1965, at an institution that officially never existed, a Chair was established that only the secret service was supposed to know about. At the Juridical Academy in Potsdam near Berlin, “Operative Psychology” (OP) was taught for almost 25 years to over 13,300 trainees of the Secret Service (Stasi) in East Germany. An increasing number of academically trained psychologists taught concepts and techniques of OP, designed to systematize and support intelligence work: Starting out with only four members, the number of employees working at the institute for OP continually grew until it peaked at 10 in 1989. Besides holding lectures and seminars, members of the institute provided an extensive corpus of teaching material and training documents and supervised more than 200 diploma and doctoral theses.Their research focused on how to apply “silent” psychological techniques of persuasion and repression (e.g., how to urge citizens to cooperate and give private information to the secret service), how to interrogate dissidents without leaving physical marks, and how to “disintegrate” opposition groups and dissidents .’</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As detailed below the ultimate goal was psychological degradation of the target by ruining social, professional, and personal connections, while simultaneously making the target doubt their own sanity. The use of false rumors, fabricated photographs, and discrediting information was spread to targets’ connections discretely. Physical actions like break-ins to the target’s house, deflating the targets tires on bikes and cars were also used. Consider the following examples from Mario Bekes’ article: <a href="https://www.mariobekes.com.au/from-berlin-to-the-digital-age-stasis-zersetzung-and-the-modern-battle-of-psychological-warfare/">‘From Berlin to the Digital Age: STASI’s Zersetzung and the Modern Battle of Psychological Warfare’</a><a href="#bib-311">[311]</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Another characteristic of Zersetzung was gaslighting, a type of psychological manipulation that led the subject to question their own memory, perception, and sanity.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Modifying the target’s surroundings:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The Stasi occasionally broke into a person’s house and left odd items or furnishings to confuse them.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Creating false memories:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Agents spread gossip or made-up stories to manipulate targets into believing they did something wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Producing contradicting information:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>The Stasi would make phone calls or send anonymous letters posing as various individuals while contradicting one another. The target would become perplexed and begin to doubt how they perceive the situation.The goal of the Stasi’s tactics was to induce self-doubt in the target by undermining their sense of control over their surroundings.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mario Bekes continues with the next section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“ <strong>Planting Paranoid Seeds</strong></p>
<p>Because Zersetzung frequently worked based on paranoia, it was very successful.</p>
<p>Stasi methods were meant to make the target feel like they were being watched, unsure of whom to trust, and afraid that loved ones would betray them.</p>
<p>They may see unusual persons observing them, hear strange noises, or receive anonymous letters.</p>
<p>The person’s anxiety and stress levels would rise as a result of these unnerving events, which would make them doubt the security of their surroundings.</p>
<p>This paranoia may also permeate the target’s public life or place of employment. The Stasi would frequently use wiretapping, monitoring, and informant recruitment to keep tabs on the target’s activities and give them the impression that they were constantly being monitored.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1916583/">Zersetzung was a deliberate psychological operation that would ultimately lead to states of paranoia, fear, and social isolation. These tactics are recognized as psychological torture.</a><a href="#bib-312">[312]</a></p>
<p>Imagine how Doctors would react if people went to them saying they were experiencing this persecution. It’s reasonable to imagine victims stating the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>‘People are spying on me’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘People are listening to my phone calls’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘People are following me’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘People are spreading rumors about me’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>‘People are breaking into my home and re-arranging my furniture’</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These can all considered signs of paranoia. None of these things could be proven. Here’s a statement from the criteria for paranoid schizophrenia from the <a href="https://www.turkpsikiyatri.org/arsiv/dsm-1952.pdf">Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) Edition 1</a>, the contemporary diagnostic tool for Psychiatrists at the time published in 1952<a href="#bib-313">[313]</a>.</p>
<p>Schizophrenic reaction, paranoid type</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This type of reaction is characterized by autistic, unrealistic thinking, with mental content composed chiefly of delusions of persecution, and/or of grandeur, ideas of reference, and often hallucinations…”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The torture of Zersetzung was intentionally designed to be seen as delusions of persecution and conspiracy against an individual. The result often resulted in extreme paranoia. Now consider the mass body of civilians reporting torture from advanced psychological weapons.</p>
<h4 id="medical-misdiagnoses-of-modern-psychological-weapon-victims">Medical Misdiagnoses of Modern Psychological Weapon Victims<a href="#medical-misdiagnoses-of-modern-psychological-weapon-victims" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"><span class="icon icon-link"></span></a></h4>
<p>Above is evidence of state sponsored psychological operations intentionally designed by academically trained psychologists to “to interrogate dissidents without leaving physical marks, and…to “disintegrate” opposition groups and dissidents’ covertly. MKUltra victims that underwent illegal psychological experiments were diagnosed with schizophrenic and psychotic symptoms and were advised to go to mental asylums. Additionally, American victims of what is being concluded to be adversarial’s directed energy weapon attacks have been told by the United States Psychiatric community that they are experiencing mass delusion and psychogenic illness despite the contrary evidence that these weapons exist and are certainly being used by our adversaries .</p>
<p>The <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39365495/">medical community similarly responds to reports of advanced psychological weapons abuse. </a> The sections above discuss numerous sources of evidence that suggest technologies that can communicate sounds and voices into people’s heads, read people’s minds, and communicate people’s thoughts over a distance have either exist or have a strong possibility of existing<a href="#bib-314">[314]</a>. It is known that foreign adversaries are conducting advanced psychological operations in our country. It is also known that there are millions of reports from US citizens and citizens world wide that advanced psychological weapons are being used on them and these reports all attest to the same technologies being used on them. Additionally, there is are a number of whistleblowers stating our own government agencies are using these technologies on civilians. The massive body of evidence that suggests this reality cannot be entirely classified as symptoms of mental illness while there is a documented plausibility that these weapons exist and are being used.</p>
<p>There is a general perception amidst the community of individuals reporting these attacks that this is one of the victimization’s goals: To have society label you as a schizophrenic so your reports and testimony is considered a delusion of the mental illness and then no one will believe you as evidenced in below social media reports:</p>
<p><a href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uO-n!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F956b085f-df1e-4af6-846f-460ff3a50614_1008x1424.png"><img src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!uO-n!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F956b085f-df1e-4af6-846f-460ff3a50614_1008x1424.png" alt=""></a><a href="#bib-315">[315]</a></p>
<p>There are also numerous resources on how a variety of types of psychological torture, torture trauma, and victimization can often result in paranoia, delusions, psychosis, and PTSD symptoms like hypervigilance. The presence of these symptoms is often misdiagnosed as schizophrenia. Consider the following resources on how torture victims, Stasi survivors, those with PTSD, and those with other forms of extreme trauma can often exhibit symptoms aligned with those used to diagnose schizophrenia:</p>

<p>“For many years western psychiatrists only out of their clinical experience have known about a syndrome for which the name Stasi-persecution-syndrome will be used here. Stasi was the all powerful secret police of what was the East German Democratic Republic. The syndrome concerns an hitherto unknown number of the aprox. 50,000 survivors. It is a sequel of a form of persecution now more generally named torture. The characteristics of the persecution include arrestion, interrogations, degradation, humiliation, maltreatment, assault, mass detention in tiny rooms, hunger, cold, discrimination, defamation, disgrace, outlaw, social degradation, absence of rights, uncertainty of future, life threatening, and stigmatizing. The sequels resemble in many aspects of what is known by the psychiatry of the persecuted, but own a special flavor. Among the sequels are persisting and paranoid anxieties, re-arousable by specific situations. There are also realistic anxiety and persecution dreams, mood disturbances, lack of confidence, attempted suicide and complaints about lack of understanding by others, which the victims suffer from.”</p>

<p>“Given the higher incidence of trauma in psychosis, research has considered whether victimization may play a causal role in psychotic experiences, at least for some people. Demonstrating the causality of trauma in psychosis is methodologically complex and research is in its infancy. However, preliminary findings are in line with the proposal that victimization does have a causal effect. Prospective, case-control, and epidemiological studies support an association, and dose-response relationships and mediation by plausible mechanisms have been demonstrated”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If advanced psychological weapons were used on civilians, it is plausible that their reports would align with the symptoms of schizophrenia. Given the evidence that these weapons exist, the plausibility that our Foreign adversaries are using them on us, the numerous whistleblower reports that our own government is using them on us, and the reports from individuals that this medical misdiagnoses is happening to them, it is convincing that this is another layer of the victimization of psychotronic weapon abuses:</p>

<p>This discussion has established the idea that schizophrenia may be used as a means to further discredit and victimize the targets of psychotronic weapons. <a href="https://www.nami.org/media-and-pop-culture/the-consequences-of-stigma-surrounding-schizophrenia/">Schizophrenia’s stigma can be humiliating, massively discrediting and socially harmful</a><a href="#bib-327">[327]</a>. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36244006/">The monetary burden of the medical system and schizophrenia related treatment is knowingly financially burdensome</a><a href="#bib-328">[328]</a>. <a href="https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/24692-antipsychotic-medications">Additionally the medications given to the victims cause varieties of physical ailments ranging from the permanent disorder of tardive dyskinesia, weight gain, exhaustion, nausea, vomiting, confusion, and many more</a><a href="#bib-329">[329]</a>. This layer of compounding victimization is a problematic prospect and potential result of the use of advanced psychological weapons on US civilians.</p>

<hr>
<p>Psychological warfare is a long standing principle of war and there is undeniable evidence that United States foreign adversaries are implementing psychological tactics to cause disruption, political volatility, and damage to our nation. The Havana Syndrome and AHI anomalies are being linked to possible Russian involvement using Directed Pulsed Energy Weapons and our intelligence agencies are denying the existence of these weapons and the idea that our enemies possess psychotronic weapon technology.</p>
<p>The development of psychological weapons that can influence the mind, degrade a target mentally, communicate voices, subliminal messages, and sounds into people’s heads, and read minds have been on the research and technological agenda of Russia and China and the US for decades as noted by people like Timothy L. Thomas. Masses of US citizens have been reporting that they have been hearing voices and experiencing a variety of other symptoms like their thoughts being read and voices being transmitted to their skulls for decades. The people who are claiming this include doctors, researchers, scientists, neuroscientists, particle physicists like Dr. Katherine Horton, engineers, and civilians of all walks of life.</p>
<p>The psychological weapons discussed as being military research objectives of Russia and China in Military Analyst Timothy Thomas’s ‘The Mind Has No Firewall’, ‘Human Network Attacks’ have been confirmed to exist by US and World military engineering experts like Dr. Eldon Byrd, David Voigts, Dr. James Giordiano, and Dr. Robert Duncan. In addition, we have documentation from research papers demonstrating that the concept of remote neural monitoring and remote brain manipulation was plausible given the technological capabilities of computers and implants back in the 70’s. There are also other reliable sources attesting to these weapons development and existence. The symptoms of these weapons’ use align with documented attacks against our military, and government personnel in the Havana Syndrome cases and the personal testimony of targeted US civilians.</p>
<p>People reporting the experience of these technologies are suffering immensely; they equate the experience as torture. Their lives are filled with pain, paranoia, and psychological torment. The symptoms of hearing voices, and minds being read are reported en mass. Some of the people experiencing this phenomenon are committing atrocities because of their suffering. Additionally, these people are experiencing further harm by medical diagnoses.</p>
<p>Given the substantial amassing body of reports of psychotronic weapons being used, experts attesting their use and existence, university, military, and scientific publications declaring that these technologies exist or that they have been on military research agendas for decades, and the overwhelming possibility that foreign adversaries, criminal organizations or even US Agencies are perpetrating these crimes, a formal and extensive investigation into the use of advanced psychological weapons on US civilians needs to be conducted.</p>
